# absolute-horizon

Demonstration of how to use...
```css
-webkit-background-clip: text;
color: transparent;
```
...to show a background through text, and also to include another image. The `<header>` contains both an `<h1>` element with a `background-image` and an `<img>` which is placed on top of the `<h1>` element using:

```css
img {
  position: absolute;
}
```
